=======================

Code for the Bachelor Thesis on the subject Information Propagation in Online Social Networks.

=== Abstract ====

In this paper the information propagation model that takes into account both internal (social) and external (authority) influence is presented and revisited. Based on the estimated parameters for the model and the randomization test called time-shuffle test, a decision whether propagation of an information item is mainly peer or authority influence driven can be made. The proposed model and its updated version were used to describe an information item - the existence of the Facebook application referendum2013.hr - as mainly propagated by external (authority) influence.
